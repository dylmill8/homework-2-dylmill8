# CS193HW2: Debugging 

## What is this assignment
As you heard from lecture, debugging is a very useful and necessary tool for developing software and solving problems. In this homework assignment you will be tasked with fixing errors in several methods. Each method solves a different problem such as finding the minimum in an array or running a binary search. The algorithm for each problem will be given, but there are small bugs littered in the code preventing the test cases from passing. 

## When is this due?
This homework will be due on **09/30** at 11:59 pm.

## When will I know I'm done?
You will know that you have finished when all the test cases pass and your code is visible on GitHub. There will be hidden test cases that checks for any hardcoded solutions.

## The Scenario
Picture this: You land a great internship as a Freshman thanks to all the skills you learned in CS193, and are put to the task of picking up where last year's IU intern left off.

Needless to say, they've left a mess of things. It's up to you to identify what's wrong with their code!

## Your Choice: IDE vs. Command Line
This homework can be completed using an IDE like IntelliJ, or using the command line. In this document, instructions are given for debugging using the command line and JDB, a command-line tool for debugging Java files. Print statements can also be used for debugging on both platforms.

The choice of which platform to use is entirely yours! We will give detailed instructions for both platforms, and will include instructions for each method in the homework repo. 

Once you've decided, follow these links to find the appropriate handout:

## Rubric
The last 4 questions will be extra credit totalling up to 5 extra credit points!! We encourage you all to try it out.
